# Forever Home

Forever Home is a MERN application for a non-profit, no-kill animal shelter that rescues animals and finds forever homes for them. The idea was derived from my personal plan to run a small animal shelter in my senior years. This application supports the shelterâ€™s mission to give back to the society and help animals.
