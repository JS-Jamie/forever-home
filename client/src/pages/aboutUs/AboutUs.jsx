              For more than 170 years, Forever Home has been serving the
              community, saving animals and helping people. Forever Home is
              still the only animal shelter in Pet Friends County, taking in all
              types of unwanted, injured, lost, stray, abandoned, and abused
              animals. Today, we help over 24,000 animals and their people
              through our array of services every year. We are governed by a
              board of directors and is supported by generous individual and
              corporate donors.

                      To advocate the compassionate treatment of animals;
                      educate the community on responsible, lifelong pet
                      ownership; and promote adoption as the best option when
                      searching for a new pet.

                      We envision a time when every companion animal is treated
                      with respect, care, and compassion as a valued, lifelong
                      member of the family. A time when there are no more
                      homeless animals resulting from irresponsible or
                      noncommittal pet ownership.
